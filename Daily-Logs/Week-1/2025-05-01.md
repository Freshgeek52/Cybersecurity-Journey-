## ðŸŽ¯ **Today's Goals**  
- [x] Analyze SonicWall SMA100 vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-44221, CVE-2024-38475)  
- [x] Study network models (OSI vs. TCP/IP), ports/protocols, and attack frameworks (Cyber Kill Chain, MITRE ATT&CK)  
- [x] Explore security controls (physical, technical, administrative) and access management models  
- [x] Review encryption basics and incident response best practices

## ðŸ“š **Concepts Learned**  
### 1. **SonicWall SMA100 Exploited Vulnerabilities**  `(News of the Day: "The hacker News")`
- **CVE-2023-44221**: Command injection flaw allowing admin-privileged attackers to execute arbitrary commands.  
- **CVE-2024-38475**: Apache HTTP Server flaw (CVSS 9.8) enabling session hijacking via URL manipulation.  
- **Mitigation**: Patch firmware, enforce MFA, restrict management interfaces.  

### 2. **Network Models & Protocols**  
- **OSI vs. TCP/IP**: Compared 7-layer OSI model to simplified 4-layer TCP/IP model.  
- **Secure Protocols**: FTPS (SSL), SFTP (SSH), SSH for secure remote access.  

### 3. **Network Threats & Frameworks**  
- **Cyber Kill Chain**: 7-stage attack flow (Reconnaissance â†’ Actions on Objectives).  
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: 14-tactic framework for adversary behavior (e.g., Lateral Movement, Exfiltration).  

### 4. **Security Controls**  
- **Types**:  
  - **Physical**: Locks, physical barrier, guards.  
  - **Technical**: Firewalls, encryption, password.  
  - **Administrative**: Security training, segregation of duties.  
- **Principles**: Least privilege, need-to-know, dual controls, clean desk policies, directives.  

### 5. **Access Management Models**  
- **DAC** (Discretionary): Access granted by owners.  
- **MAC** (Mandatory): System-enforced access (e.g., military).  
- **RBAC** (Role-Based): Access tied to job roles.  

### 6. **Encryption & Cryptography**  
- **Symmetric**: AES (shared key).  
- **Asymmetric**: RSA (public/private keys).  
- **Hashing**: MD5 (deprecated), SHA-256 for integrity.  

### 7. **Incident Response (IR)**  
- **Key Steps**: Preparation, detection, containment, eradication, recovery.  
- **Best Practices**: Tabletop exercises, multidisciplinary IR teams, stakeholder communication plans.
