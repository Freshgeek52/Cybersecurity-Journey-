### **Daily Documentation - May 9, 2025**  


#### **1. Concepts Learned**  
- **Cyber Attacks & Vulnerabilities**:  
  - **CVE-2025-31324** (CVSS 10.0): Critical SAP NetWeaver RCE flaw exploited by **Chaya_004** (China-linked) to deploy **SuperShell** and **Brute Ratel C4** post-exploitation tools.  
  - **Googleâ€™s AI Protections**: Gemini Nano powers on-device scam detection in Chrome 137, reducing fake websites by **80%** in search results. Future Android 16 updates aim to disable JavaScript/2G by default.  
- **Windows Services**:  
  - **Service Control Manager (SCM)**: Manages background services (e.g., Windows Update, Print Spooler).  
  - **Service Attack Vectors**: Unquoted service paths, user-writable paths, and hijacking via malicious DLLs.

#### **2. Lab Exercises**  
**Tools Used**: PowerShell, Service Control Manager (SCM), WMIC, Event Viewer.  
**Steps & Outcomes**:  
- **Guided Exercise**:  
  - Explored service properties (Startup Type, Dependencies, Log On credentials) using SCM and PowerShell (`Get-Service`).  
  - Identified **unquoted service paths** via WMIC:  
    ```cmd
    wmic service get name,pathname,startmode | findstr /i "auto" | findstr /i /v "c:\windows\\" | findstr /i /v """
    ```  
  - Simulated attack by replacing `WindowsService1.exe` with `EvilWindowsService.exe` in an unquoted path (`C:\Program Files\my service`).  
- **Challenge Exercise**:  
  - Identified vulnerable services, analyzed event logs for malicious activity.

#### **3. Screenshots/Code Snippets**  
**Key Commands**:  
```powershell
# List all services with executable paths
wmic service get name,pathname

# Filter running services
Get-Service | Where-Object Status -EQ "Running"

# Create a vulnerable service
New-Service -Name MyService -BinaryPathName "C:\Program Files\my service\WindowsService1.exe"
```


#### **4. Challenges Faced**  
- **Unquoted Path Detection**: Initial difficulty parsing WMIC output; resolved using predefined scripts.  
- **Service Hijacking**: Permission issues when replacing executables; required admin privileges.  
- **Event Log Analysis**: Overwhelming log entries; filtered using `EventID 0` and source `SimpleService`.  


#### **5. Resources**  
- Cybrary 

#### **6. Reflection**  
- **What Clicked**:  
  - Service lifecycle management (start/stop via PowerShell).  
  - Exploiting unquoted service paths for privilege escalation.  
- **Needs Revisiting**:  
  - Advanced service dependency troubleshooting.  
  - Defensive hardening against DLL hijacking.

#### **7. Certification Progress**  
- **Study Hours**: 4 hours (Windows services, SAP vulnerabilities).  
- **Exam Prep**: Focused on enterprise service vulnerabilities and AI-driven threat detection mechanisms.
