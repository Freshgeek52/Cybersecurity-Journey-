# Cybersecurity Study Log - May 5, 2025 üìÖ

## üóûÔ∏è **Daily News Summary**  

## üéØ **Today's Goals**  
1. **Understand Ransomware Trends**: Analyze the shift from encryption-focused attacks to data theft and "lone-wolf" tactics.  
2. **GDPR Compliance Insights**: Grasp the legal implications of cross-border data transfers and TikTok‚Äôs recurring failures.  
3. **State-Sponsored Threat Awareness**: Study Iranian APT tactics (VPN exploits, credential harvesting) and defensive countermeasures.  
4. **Linux File System Mastery**: Identify critical directories (`/dev`, `/var`, `/usr/sbin`) and their roles in system operations.  
5. **Network Layer Analysis**: Map Wireshark‚Äôs packet dissection to OSI/TCP/IP models, focusing on Physical (Radiotap) and Application (HTTP) layers.  
6. **IP Addressing Fundamentals**: Configure and troubleshoot subnets, gateways, and ARP caches in a simulated GNS3 environment.  
7. **Network Device Roles**: Differentiate switches (Layer 2), routers (Layer 3), and legacy devices (hubs, bridges)

### *Key Cybersecurity Headlines from TheHackers News*  

### **1. U.S. Charges Yemeni Hacker Behind Black Kingdom Ransomware**  
- **Summary**: Yemeni national Rami Khaled Ahmed charged for deploying Black Kingdom ransomware via ProxyLogon vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855). Targeted 1,500+ systems globally, including hospitals and schools.  
- **Trends**:  
  - Ransomware attacks surged 126% YoY (Q1 2025), but median payouts dropped to $115k.  
  - Shift toward "lone-wolf" tactics and data theft over encryption.  
- **Law Enforcement Action**: Collaboration with Yemen, Ukraine, and Spain to dismantle cybercrime networks like Scattered Spider and Nefilim ransomware groups.  

### **2. TikTok Fined ‚Ç¨530 Million Under GDPR**  
- **Violations**: Unlawful transfer of EU user data to China and transparency failures.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - TikTok‚Äôs "Project Clover" deemed insufficient for compliance.  
  - Second major GDPR penalty since 2023 (previous: ‚Ç¨345M for mishandling children‚Äôs data).  
- **Impact**: Must suspend China-bound data transfers within 6 months.  

### **3. Iranian Hackers Target Middle East CNI**  
- **Group**: Lemon Sandstorm (state-sponsored) exploited VPN flaws (Fortinet, Pulse Secure) for 2-year access.  
- **Tools**: Havoc C2, NeoExpressRAT, SystemBC ransomware precursor, and custom malware like HanifNet.  
- **Defense Recommendations**: Patch management, MFA, and network segmentation.

## üìö **Courses & Labs**  

### **Linux File System Basics**  
#### *Challenge Exercise*  
1. **Device Files Directory**:  
   ```bash
   /dev
   ```  
2. **Administrative Tools Directory**:  
   ```bash
   /usr/sbin
   ```  
3. **Common Commands Directory**:  
   ```bash
   /usr/bin
   ```  
4. **Variable Data Directory**:  
   ```bash
   /var
   ```

### **Network Reference Models**  
#### *Guided Exercise with Wireshark*  
- **TCP/IP vs. OSI Layers**:  
  - Wireshark combines OSI Layers 5-7 (Application) and separates Layers 1-2 (Physical/Data Link).  
- **Key Observations**:  
  - **Physical Layer**: Radiotap headers (signal strength, frequency).  
  - **Data Link Layer**: MAC addresses in 802.11 Beacon frames.  
  - **Application Layer**: Captured HTTP flag `CTF{CLAB_PRATICUM}`.

### **IP Addressing Basics**  
#### *Guided Exercise in GNS3*  
- **Host Configurations**:  
  - **Linux-2 Flag**: Found in `/etc/network/interfaces` ‚Üí `CTF{NETWORKhero!}`.  
- **ARP Cache Analysis**:  
  - After pinging `192.168.1.10`, only the router‚Äôs MAC (`00:1a:2b:3c:4d:5e`) was cached (non-local hosts require routers).  
- **Connectivity Tests**:  
  - Router shutdown confirmed traffic isolation between subnets.

### **Network Device Basics**  
#### *Core Concepts*  
- **Key Devices**:  
  - **Switch (Layer 2)**: Directs LAN traffic using MAC addresses.  
  - **Router (Layer 3)**: Routes traffic between subnets.  
  - **Firewall/VPN/Proxy**: Critical for security and traffic management.  
  - **The network interface card (NIC)**: connects servers and clients to the network.
  - **An unshielded twisted pair (UTP)**:  cable plugs directly into the NIC and then to a wall outlet, where another UTP cable will run to a patch panel in a server room. A third UTP cable will then make the connection from the patch panel in the server room to a port on a switch. 
- **Legacy Devices**: Hubs (obsolete), bridges (merge LANs), repeaters (extend cables).
