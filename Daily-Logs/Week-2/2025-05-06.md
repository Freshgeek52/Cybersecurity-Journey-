## 🗞️ **Daily News Summary**  
### *Critical Security Updates & Exploits*  

### **1. Critical Android Flaw Patched (CVE-2025-27363)**  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Google patched **46 vulnerabilities**, including an actively exploited **local code execution flaw** (CVSS 8.1) in Android's System component.  
  - Exploits FreeType font library (≤v2.13.0) via **out-of-bounds write** during font parsing.  
  - **No user interaction** required; first disclosed by Facebook in March 2025.  
- **Additional Fixes**: 8 System and 15 Framework flaws addressing privilege escalation, DoS, and data leaks.  
- **Action**: Update Android immediately.  

**Key Takeaway**: Prioritize patching to mitigate silent exploitation risks.  

### **2. Langflow RCE Flaw Added to CISA KEV (CVE-2025-3248)**  
- **Key Points**:  
  - **CVSS 9.8** vulnerability in Langflow’s `/api/v1/validate/code` endpoint allows **unauthenticated RCE** via Python’s `exec()`.  
  - Public PoC exploit available; **466 exposed instances** globally.  
  - Federal agencies must patch by **May 26, 2025**.  
- **Action**: Upgrade to Langflow v1.3.0.  

**Key Takeaway**: Secure code validation is critical for internet-facing apps.

## 💻 **Courses & Labs**  

### **Network Device Basics (GNS3 Lab)**  
#### *Guided Exercise Highlights*  
1. **Firewall Configuration**:  
   - Set up pfSense firewall as gateway (`192.168.1.1`).  
   - Tested connectivity via ping to ISP (`66.67.68.1`).  
2. **DHCP & Host Config**:  
   - DHCP range: `192.168.1.100-200`.  
   - Verified Linux-1 DHCP assignment.  
3. **Firewall Rules**:  
   - Default **deny all** on WAN; permissive LAN rules.  
4. **Subnet Expansion**:  
   - Added `10.10.10.0/24` subnet via Router (`192.168.1.254`).  
   - Configured static routes on pfSense.  

**Flag Captured**: `{LayerCake}`

### **Cryptography Basics**  
#### *Core Concepts*  
- **Caesar Cipher**: Shift-based encryption (e.g., shift 3: A→D).  
- **Key Management**: Critical for confidentiality (e.g., WWII Enigma machine).  
- **Modern Algorithms**: AES (symmetric), RSA (asymmetric).  

#### *Guided Exercise*  
- Encrypted "Bring Caesar a Salad!" with key `5` → `GWNLJ FXFQFI XFQ F XFQFI!`  
- Decrypted ciphertexts using brute-force:  
  - `SLAAJ AFAAJ` → **"BE SURE TO DRINK YOUR OVALTINE"** (Key: `24`).  

**Challenge Answers**:  
1. `BE SURE TO DRINK YOUR OVALTIN` (Key: `24`)  
2. `THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF` (Key: `15`)  
3. `MR WATSON COME HERE I WANT YOU` (Key: `3`)

### **Symmetric Cryptography**  
#### *Guided Exercise*  
1. **Key Generation & Sharing**:  
   ```bash
   openssl genpkey -algorithm rsa -out keyforjohn.key
   base64 keyforjohn.key > keyforjohn.send
   ```  
2. **Message Encryption/Decryption**:  
   - Encrypted "Be sure to drink your ovaltine!" using shared key.  
   - Decrypted via:  
     ```bash
     openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey keyforjohn.key -in message.enc
     ```  

**Key Insight**: Symmetric encryption is fast but scales poorly (N² key pairs).

## 🏆 **Progress Tracking**  
- **Completed**:  
  ✅ News analysis & vulnerability mapping  
  ✅ Network device lab (subnetting, firewall rules)  
  ✅ Caesar Cipher encryption/decryption  
  ✅ Symmetric key exchange & message encryption  
- **Next Steps**:  
  - Explore hybrid TLS encryption (symmetric + asymmetric).  
  - Configure VLANs in GNS3.
