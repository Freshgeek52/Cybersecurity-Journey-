# Cybersecurity-Journey 🛡️  
**A structured, hands-on roadmap to mastering cybersecurity fundamentals and SOC operations**  

### 📌 **Purpose**  
This repository documents my disciplined journey toward building expertise in cybersecurity, with a focus on **threat detection**, **incident response**, and **Security Operations Center (SOC)** workflows. Through daily logs, lab write-ups, and certification progress, I aim to bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world practice, demonstrating my commitment to a career in defending digital infrastructure.  

### 🚀 **Why This Repository?**  
- **Proactive Learning**: Daily progress tracking reflects consistency, curiosity, and accountability.  
- **Transparency**: Anyone can see my problem-solving process, from lab struggles to solutions.  
- **Skill Validation**: Hands-on labs (TryHackMe, LetsDefend, Blueteam, Cybrary) and certifications(CompTIA Security+, BTL1) prove technical proficiency.  
- **Growth Mindset**: Iterative improvements in threat analysis, tooling, and defensive strategies are openly documented.  

### 🔍 **What’s Inside?**  
- **Daily Logs**: Detailed notes on concepts learned, labs completed, and challenges overcome.  
- **Lab Reports**: Step-by-step walkthroughs of SOC simulations, malware analysis, and network forensics.  
- **Certification Prep**: Study plans, practice exams, and progress tracking for industry-recognized certs.  
- **Tooling & Scripts**: Custom scripts (Python/Bash), SIEM configurations, and automation snippets.  
- **Resources**: Curated threat intelligence, MITRE ATT&CK mappings, and defensive playbooks.  

### 🌟 **Highlights for Employers**  
1. **Practical Expertise**:  
   - SIEM: Splunk.  
   - Network Analysis: Wireshark, Zeek.  
   - Incident Response: NIST Framework, forensic tools (Autopsy, FTK).  
2. **Soft Skills**:  
   - Clear documentation, critical thinking, and collaborative troubleshooting (via community engagement).  
3. **Career Focus**:  
   - Tailored for **SOC Analyst**, **Threat Hunter**, or **Cybersecurity Engineer** roles.  

### 📈 **Current Goals**  
- [ ] Earn **CompTIA Security+** (Exam SY0-701).  
- [ ] Complete **Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1)** certification.  
- [ ] Build a home lab with Security Onion for threat detection simulations.
